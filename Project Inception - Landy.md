## Project 1: Project Inception

#### Introduction

My name is Dmitry Landy and I am planning on developing a web application that can be used in my wife's website. At the moment, I only have a vague idea of what to create. The website already well developed and organized, but it does lack a section where people can interact with her. Perhaps, the web application can be forum of sorts or a fan-page. This could be something where an account has to be created in order to post anything. A database would keep track of the users and another for the content. Some of the content could include the following:

- Comments
- Suggestions
- Fan-art
- Photos of products in use


#### Application 1: ArtStation

The first web application to analyze is [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/about). This application is used to provide artists to showcase their portfolios to the public. It also has a new feature that allows users to buy and sell their artwork through their marketplace. Some features that I am interested in are:

- [Login process](https://www.artstation.com/registration/signup)
- [Prints gallery](https://www.artstation.com/prints)

Since I plan on having users login before using an application, the login process is something that must be developed. ArtStation has a very functional and appealing GUI for creating an account and logging in. There is also a process for verifying the account information. The format of the GUI and process can definitely be applied to my project.

The prints gallery allows users to post images that appear as an appealing collection. Hovering over the images provides additional details. This feature could be used in my application for fan art or photos from the users. Selecting the photo provides even more information about the photo and the user who posted it.

#### Application 2: Reddit

The second web application to analyze is [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). This application is used to provide user a social platform to discuss topics and post multimedia content. Each post can have other users reply to it as well as vote on the post (up-vote or down-vote). Creating the post prompts the user to enter a few fields (such as title, text, multimedia, and links). The text of the post can be formatted as well as any replies to it. The posts are able to support markdown, which can make formatting easier for those familiar with it. The user interface for creating these posts and reacting to them is very simple and convenient. The data from the posts would have to be stored in a database. This type of discussion/comments section could be added to my web application.

#### Application 3: Twitter

The third and last web application to analyze is [Twitter](https://twitter.com/explore), which combines the previous two concepts into one. Twitter allows users to post content, with or without multimedia, and then have discussions about them via the comment section. This idea could be used for gallery posts that have a limited comment section. Twitter's "tweets" are engaging due to the small messages or clear multimedia shown. Each post can be commented on, shared, re-tweeted, or "liked". These features allow for convenient social interactions. Each post is time-stamped, which can provide the relevance of that post. The data about each post would have to be stored in a database and managed. 

#### Conclusion

The web application is meant to create more cohesion between the customer and business owner. It would contain a section for the gallery and another for the suggestions. The gallery would mimic something from ArtStation's [gallery](https://www.artstation.com/prints). Users (e.g. customers) would be able to post photos of their use of the products or fan-art and others would be able to comment and react to the post. The suggestion box would be a forum where users could suggest updates to the products or new products altogether. The web-application for this fan-page will be used to stimulate interaction between the business-owner and the customers. This relationship will foster a close community of the two and benefit both parties.
